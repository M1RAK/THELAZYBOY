The question of destiny and man's freewill.
It feels so, it looks, and even tastes so. The freedom to do anything and everything, inspire of, despite being.
Freedom is a prison, it harbours no prisoner, yet it destroyed many a great man, the slow ticking of the wall clock towards the days end brings one who has done naught with his day, tears and bitterness, which he forgets in his quiet slumber andhides from the naked truth in daylight, that he merely exists. He is slowly moving back on the heels of regret, alone only he is the criminal and the crime committed for having not hit his peak nor worse never truly gave it a shot.
