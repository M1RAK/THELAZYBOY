The curse of perfection  
To be or not to be, that is never the question with the perfectionist. Because he dwells on the inside, beside and underneath the subconscious, beyoind the consious and seems to steal from our best efforts a nugget of imperfection. Which leads to endless rummages through the slits of our minds sowing the endless mirages of what if, if only and so on.
What is the cure to this madness?
To remove thought, that to madness, to find a way to escape the mind, no rather to unstable and potentially dangerous. To let go seems to be the only act worth learning from, to sit with tiny discomforts that once nibbled at your mind's eye. To practice letting things be, to let them take their natural course. It's all rather simple really, gruesome to exercise.
Distraction from the object of focus , only magnifies it in kind, a kind of pink elephant. To let go is a constant struggle, but for many of us, it's an escape into the world of dreams, a place where we once controlled all there is and seems to be.
The spiritualist believe it is so due to a build up of to much energy directed at one source and like and unflowing river it is prone to infestations, pollution and extinction of the life within it
