MIND OVER MATTER.
The dreams of a lonely mind. The truth of it, what is it and how does it happen for it is the only element that changes every so quickly and yet persists in its erring. What is the soul, what is the pysche and what is the teuth.
The universe is mental, yet we are the crazy ones. I think by now the world would have caught on to this tiny glitch in the matrix, the loophole of infinite possibilities torn into the fabric of the universe, do we persist against all knowledge and plunge into the abyss, for the universe is as they say mental, yet one must only persist in his delusion. U til it comes forward and serves you what you have refused to give in about. To seek that which is our birthright. To rule above the food chain, blessed with the mind and it's capacity to elevate by consious standing. I guess my argument is if it were all so easy? Why isn't everyone doing it, why!!!. or rather why not.Â **we are what we are, the only creatures that know it so instinctually but still fail to seize the moment, then mop and wail over spilled milk.** Wasting time we no longer, posses.
