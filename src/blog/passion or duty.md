The wisdom to let go.
To wait until right action occurs by itself, the desire to rein in the force of natural occurrence deadly and stupid.
Watch, said the mama fish to her impatient fingerling, slowly but surely, the worm was eaten, but the fish who ate was also eaten.
Mama fish said, "fish with its mouth closed doesn't get caught."
The conviction in patience is perhaps the most beautiful virtue that a man can have. To be in haste leads to blunders, to acts that save none and waste more time and effort if only to look once and see it for what it is nothing worthy of wasted time. Like an animal with no sense of time never seems in distress, perhaps only when about to be devoured. One must also keep a calm head, harder said than done of course.
> Lightly, that's the only word I can think of when I think of situations that require one's soul to stew in waiting and waiting and more waiting.

Pre meditatio malorum; God's blessings on the eternally vigilant. To be knocked upside down and over and yet for ones heart to remain unstirred only driven further into conviction.
> Perhaps that's why it is only man who stands taller no matter how many times you beat him down, he rises up and proudly beats his chest urging you to give it your best shot.
