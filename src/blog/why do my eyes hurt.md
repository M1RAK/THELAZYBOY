description: A short introduction to the redpill.
---

The Red Pill is an online forum where men discuss what they believe are the social, political, and economic consequences of the feminist movement. They believe that society has been “feminized” to their detriment—emphasizing feelings over facts, and promoting that women are victims of oppression.
The Red Pill is a term used in the manosphere to describe those who have woken up to the reality of gynocentrism and the ways it affects men. The term is used as a metaphor for the red pill that Morpheus offers Neo in The Matrix, which allows him to see past what he has been told about reality.
The Red Pill is a subreddit on Reddit that is dedicated to sexual strategy in a culture of female entitlement. It was created about ten years ago by a man who uses the pseudonym "Pook."
The Red Pill discusses what it calls the "sexual marketplace" and how to navigate it. The philosophy of the Red Pill is that male sexuality, or at least sexuality in general, is inherently different from female sexuality. The Red Pill's proponents believe that women are sexually attracted to men who possess qualities like social dominance, intelligence, and wealth but they also believe that these traits are not distributed equally among men.
The most popular book on this topic is probably the book called "The Rational Male: The Complete Guide to the Basics" by Rollo Tomassi. This book can be seen as an extension of a thread on the Red Pill called "Why Women Shouldn't Have All the Power" that was started five years ago.The book The Rational Male is an extension of a thread on The Red Pill called "Why Women Shouldn't Have All the Power" that was started five years ago by Rollo Tomassi and continues to generate debate between feminists and male activists.
RedPill Handbook is an online book written by Reddit user Pookah47 which provides advice on how to be more successful with women. The author claims that he was able to seduce any woman he wanted using his techniques. He also discusses his theories about female psychology and how it relates to sexual behavior.
The Red Pill Handbook and Rational Male: The Complete Guide to the Basics are two books written by "red pillers" for other men. They are both guides on how men can navigate life as an average guy in this day and age, where feminism has made it difficult for them.
The Red Pill Handbook: A Practical Guide to the Red Pill by Athol Kay, also known as "Roosh V" (a pseudonym), is a book that was published on February 2nd 2016. The book provides knowledge about what it means to be a man in today's society and how to be successful with women.
