### Nature will weed your genes out of existence if you do not learn how to attract women.

 and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years research into the feminine soul, is ‘What do women want?’ <span><i class='ri-double-quotes-r'></i></span></p>

### Lesson 1: Actions not words

> John called his girlfriend and asked her out. John was nervous, was scared; he
> was shy.

> “So we’re set for tomorrow night?”

> “Umm, yeah,” she replied.

> Then, tomorrow night came. John agonized over the date the entire day. How
> should he act? What shall he wear? Did he have enough money? Would he be fun
> enough?”

> But poor John realized he was wasting his time worrying for there was no date.
> He got stood up.

> Obviously, there HAD to be a reason. Perhaps something awful happened. Perhaps
> her car didn’t start. Perhaps some incredible thing occurred in her life AT THAT
> TIME that kept apart the two star crossed lovers!

> So he tried again. “Did we miscommunicate?”

> “Oh, umm…Yeah.”

> “You still want to go out?”

> “Sure.”

> “Let’s go out on this and this day. OK?”

> “OK!”

> That day comes. John gets stood up yet again.

> But he rationalized it away. She did say she had things going on in her life. She did
> say that she wanted to go out with him. She did say that she wouldn’t mind
> spending time with him. Obviously, something had to have come up. After all, she
> SAID she wanted to go!

> So John calls again and sets up another date. Likewise, he got stood up AGAIN.
> “Argh!” he screams to himself. “It is my fault. For I should…

#### “Judge by actions, not by words.”

> Pook then took the young man to a wall with a majestic painting on it. The painting
> showed a young man, much like the young man in person, standing before a
> feminine monster, a sphinx!

“What is that monster?” cried the young man.

“Why,” said the Pook,

“it is All Women, Mother Nature herself! This nasty sphinx
devours all hearts and lives of those who cannot answer her riddle. That man, in
the picture, he figured out the riddle to Woman. Thus, he became known as Don
Juan.”

“And the answer to the riddle?”

“Is that there is no riddle. Woman is a sphinx with no secret. It is only our minds
that we assign her secrets, mysteries, pedestals, and goddess-like status.”

> Pook noticed that the young man was confused so he elaborated.
> “Look at the above example! Look at how the lad got stood up over and over and, yet, over and
> over he rationalized the standing up! How often is it that a lad rationalizes ‘signals’
> to his liking?

How often is it that a lad offers gifts and treasures as sacrifices to her goddess-likeness for in his mind she is a goddess?
How often is it that a lad’s overactive imagination converts her disrespect, her shallowness, her flaws, into love?”

“So we paint the image we want to see?”

“Exactly! Judge by her actions and not by her words. Judge by what she does than
by what your mind wants to see. Our vanity will convert the image of every
disinterested girl into secretly loving us (for women tell us what we want to hear).
This is why we must judge by her actions and not by her words.'

> So why did she leave?
