The obsession of  obsessions  
To concieve of the greatest gift, which is to love and to live without fear, without any care, with a seriousness that one has only a space of two breaths. To live all of life in an instant, to reject all desire to be dragged into the world of Oblivion of deceit and distraction. To rebel against as an act of detachment and rebellion.
As in the candletilt of fear, in a swift act that last merely a minute, often transforms  a life with full magnanimity into the nature of reality , without hindrances nor excuses, no desire to effuse praise and none whatsoever to take it, to be in the fulfillment of the moment itself, without lust ,nor desire of any results.
In the moments such as those, the spirit tugs at the soul, urging it to lurch, to charge , to attack. Many a man, myself included have failed to seize the moment . And that bitter pill we take and we swallow and we crystallize our sorrow and in our best act, shone our cowardice and seize the moment in a violent act of retribution, to relieve the soul of it's heavy burdens proving on and the same. We are what we decide.
