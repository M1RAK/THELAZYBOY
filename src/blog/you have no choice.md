The girl in blue.
  From the moment's heat;
She stared me blind, Yet saw me in completness. A
thousand souls I'd walked past, none had ever seen me whole.
 A beating heart, another soul to call home.
 What makes her special?
It is not her tresses,though they overflow from the Ganges to the Taj Mahal.
It is simply, in her being for she burns like an Icarus flame, with reckless abandon.
It's always in the eyes, always for I've have seen it; The fears of a bird with broken wings drowning in the flood.
Truth is; I am no sailor. But I'll still set sail.
