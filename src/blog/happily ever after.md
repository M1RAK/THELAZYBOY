Why do I need to do something grand, something the world and the people who will eventually die remember, because to be human is to be afflictied with the desire to be immortal if not I. Our actions, but must surely by thought, for I have been to the abyss, running after a glint of salvation that perhaps never arrives, instead one must learn to give In rather than give up, to not be in needless fret over the events of the day, it is the will of life and as such embrace it, for it goes on and wise stays with it , shifting, counterbalancing and practicing the art of living itself, without contradicting her, but simply finding a place in the plain and the hollows of life.
