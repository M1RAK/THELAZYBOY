The Human crab story
 Why do we laugh at the judge that judges us. To let go of a sense of inadequacy, to somehow safe face about lack of courage, the questions that plague the human, all too human soul. The consideration of me, me and me alone. To not look outside oneself but rather to see everything from within. The man who dreams must always remain awakened, lest his slumber take him in his wake. To every dog, there is a day of reckoning, not for what it did, but for that which it failed to do, To spite or to hide away from the spotlight is inconsequential, for the judge, conscience, she lies within and like a true mirror points at the sags and folds of skin hanging of our chin. It's nature, it's life, it's essentially what we resist, change. The ultimate being. To not be.
