OUT OF HIS DEPTHS.
The pain seeped through the soul, now flowing in the veins, the lethargy of a thousand nights burden this here my heart. Tired and forgetting the truimphs of the day before, it never existed as the horizon looms and with it its greatest warning, move or be left behind. Advance or be a thing of the past. Rue your own soul with thy own hand and not having let a day go by without my striving for the truth, the meaning of a wall half built that turns itself over at the wakefulness of the laboures, the house that falls apart on its owner, with or without permission, simply what it is meant to do.
