Out of my mind.
The man who stands at the mountain peak is not the one who complained it was too cold , it was to steep, it was too dangerous. For the obstacles donor stand in our way, bit rather clear our paths as we set out to define ourselves, to mold our destinies from our own blood, tool and tears. To strive not for perfection, to strive for the truth and the transcendental in what we do?. Is it the paycheck, the jobs we loath, or rather the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, ambitions on a silver moon. Dreams that we dreamt years of young, reality we mold to fit our rationale rather than our grand delusions.
